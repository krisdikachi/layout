		<p style="font-size: 30px" class="body">The giant panda, also known as the panda bear, is a bear species endemic to China. It is characterised by its bold black-and-white coat and rotund body. The name "giant panda" is sometimes used to distinguish it from the red panda, a neighboring musteloid.They are too dangerous, expensive, and require too much space to be positive companions for most humans. Most importantly, keeping one of these animals is illegal due to their status as vulnerable and endangered species</p>
